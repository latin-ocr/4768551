STATEMENT ΟΝ ΒυΡΙ-ΙΕΑΤΕ tMAGES

This reei ot- rrticrotiirrt contains materiai
witich itas paper color changes, stains, or
illustrations (some of witich may appear ort
peges mixed with printed text). iri order to

ensure that aii text and illustrations are
iegibie, exposure settinqs must be changed.

Therefore‚ when text end iiiustratiorts exist
irt a sinqie image or when materiei
becquounds differ, such trames may need
to be exposed twice.

The first exposure retiects the camera
operator’s bestettort to capture the majority
of the text; tite second exposure reflects the

camera operator’s best effort to capture
iliustrative materiai or the remaining text. it

is hoped that this practice witi resuit irt a
microtiirn product thet tuiiy serves tite needs

ot most reseerchers
